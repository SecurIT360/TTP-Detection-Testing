## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/003)
<blockquote>Adversaries may abuse CMSTP to proxy execution of malicious code or to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002).

The Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (CMSTP.exe) is a command-line program used to install Connection Manager service profiles. (Citation: Microsoft Connection Manager Oct 2009) CMSTP.exe accepts an installation information file (INF) as a parameter and installs a service profile leveraged for remote access connections.

CMSTP.exe can be abused to and execute arbitrary commands from a malicious INF through an auto-elevated COM interface. (Citation: MSitPros CMSTP Aug 2017) (Citation: GitHub Ultimate AppLocker Bypass List) (Citation: Endurant CMSTP July 2018)</blockquote>
